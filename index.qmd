# Welcome {-}

This book is specifically aimed at spatial data processing for empirical statistical projects, where spatial variables become part of the analysis dataset. Over the years, I have seen many students and researchers spend excessive time just processing spatial data, often by endlessly clicking through the ArcGIS (or QGIS) user interface. From an academic productivity perspective, this is a waste of time. My hope is that this book helps researchers become more proficient in spatial data processing, ultimately enhancing productivity in economics and other scientific fields where spatial data is essential.
